Press Ctrl + ` (backtick) to open the integrated terminal.

Step 3: Start the Backend
Run this command in the terminal:

Wait until you see: Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000

Step 4: Open a New Terminal for Frontend
Click the "+" icon in the terminal to open a new terminal tab.

Step 5: Start the Frontend
Run this command in the new terminal:

Wait until you see: Local: http://localhost:3000

Step 6: Open in Browser

I'll help you deploy your project! Let me guide you through deploying both the frontend and backend.

Part 1: Deploy Backend (Python Flask) to Render
Go to: https://render.com
Sign up with your GitHub account
Click "New +" and select "Web Service"
Connect your GitHub repository:
Search for Integrated-Review-YT-Videos
Click "Connect"
Configure the service:
Name: yt-sentiment-backend
Environment: Python 3
Build Command: pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
Start Command: cd backend && python app.py
Free Plan: Select (or paid if you prefer)
Click "Create Web Service"
Wait 3-5 minutes for deployment
Copy your Backend URL (looks like: https://yt-sentiment-backend.onrender.com)
Part 2: Deploy Frontend (Next.js) to Vercel
Go to: https://vercel.com
Sign up with your GitHub account
Click "Add New..." and select "Project"
Import your GitHub repository:
Search for Integrated-Review-YT-Videos
Click "Import"
Configure the project:
Framework Preset: Next.js
Click on "Environment Variables"
Add a new variable:
Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL
Value: https://yt-sentiment-backend.onrender.com (your backend URL from Part 1)
Click "Deploy"
Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
Copy your Frontend URL (looks like: https://yt-sentiment-xxx.vercel.app)
Part 3: Update Backend to Accept Frontend Domain
Go back to Render and add your Vercel frontend URL to CORS settings in app.py:

In route.ts, the NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL will automatically use your backend URL.

Live Links After Deployment:
Frontend: https://yt-sentiment-xxx.vercel.app
Backend: https://yt-sentiment-backend.onrender.com
Let me know once you complete the deployment steps, and I'll verify everything is working!

Just share:

Your Vercel frontend URL
Your Render backend URL
And I'll test and confirm both are connected properly! 🚀
